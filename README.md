## Acknowledgement
This widget uses a version of [Gondwana's widget-factory](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/fitbit-simple-widget) including `config` which provides an easy access to properties of the `<use>` and its children in `SVG` and/or `CSS`.(The last one, I managed to kill)\
To create your own widget have a look at [Gondwana's fitbit-widget-template](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/fitbit-widget-template).
